# Save to Google Drive
**A Google Workspace Add-on for Gmail and Google Drive**

This Gmail add-on allows the user to save the open email message into a Google Drive folder. Users can also choose which attachments within the entire thread or conversation they wish to save, or none at all. Chosen attachments will be linked at the bottom of the email pdf and saved to the same location as the email.

Users can save quick-access folder shortcuts ("Saved Folders") using the triple dot menu and following the instructions.
