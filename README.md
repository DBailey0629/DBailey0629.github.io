I've been developing webapps for personal use for more than a decade. 

Lately I've been writing lots of Google Apps Script to make my workflow easier in my current job. 

Notably, I've developed a GMail Add-on that allows users to save an email as a PDF directly into their Google Drive -- no more saving to the computer and dragging it back into the Google Drive!

Another popular GMail Add-on adds a folder structure to a given folder. This is useful for standardized activity management.
