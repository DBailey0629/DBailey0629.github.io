# Privacy Policy for Save to Google Drive<br>
This Privacy Policy describes how Save to Google Drive (the "Add-on"), a Google Workspace Add-on for Gmail, collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the Add-on. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly. This Add-on was created by Daniel Bailey and is not a product of Google or its parent company.

## Information We Collect:

### The Add-on accesses the following information from your Google Workspace account:

<b>Email Content:</b> The side-panel of the Add-on accesses the sender, date, and time of the currently open email to confirm to the user that the correct email to save has been selected. During the save process, the Add-on accesses all content of the open email to be saved as a PDF, including the sender, recipient(s), subject, body, attachments, headers, and all attachments associated with emails in the email thread or conversation. This access is solely for the purpose of generating the PDF and saving it and any selected attachments to the Google Drive.<br>
<b>Google Drive:</b> The Add-on accesses your Google Drive to allow you to select a folder where you want to save the PDF. This access is limited to the folder selection process and the act of saving the generated PDF. We do not access or collect any other files in your Google Drive.<br>
<b>User Identification:</b> The Add-on accesses the user's display name associated with their Google profile. This is only done to personalize your experience and is not used for tracking outside of your Google Workspace account.

## How We Use Your Information:

We do not share your email content, Google Drive files, or any other personal information with any third parties, including advertisers or other organizations. Your data remains within your Google Workspace environment.

## Data Storage:

The Add-on runs on Google servers and does not store your email content or the generated PDF on external servers. The PDF is saved directly to your designated folder in Google Drive. We may retain minimal application usage data (e.g., successful save counts) for debugging and performance monitoring purposes. This data is anonymized and does not include any personal information. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy:

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the Add-on’s description in the Google Workspace Marketplace and/or within the Add-on itself. Your continued use of the Add-on following the posting of such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
